# XBPS Repository for libselinux and libsepol
This repo contains xbps packages for libselinux and libsepol, specifically because they are required for a proper MATLAB installation (although other programs may require them).

Package build templates can be found [here](https://github.com/Gigahawk/void-packages/tree/libselinux).

The reason these packages can't be listed in the main repository can be found [here](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/10689).
